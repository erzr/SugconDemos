                <p>GraphQL supports the <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/advanced/subscriptions.html">subscription</a> operation type.</p>
                <p>Subscriptions allow the server to push messages to clients that are listening via a websocket.</p>
                <p>
                  <a href="https://jss.sitecore.com/">Sitecore JSS</a> disables server side rendering (SSR) on subscription operations since the subscriptions are meant to stay open for as long as the component is active 
                  which would cause the server side rendering to never complete. This functionality is available client side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This example uses three subscriptions to listen to different GraphQL endpoint subscription fields. Even though these are separate subscriptions, they all use the same websocket connection.

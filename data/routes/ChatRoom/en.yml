                <p>This is proof of concept chat powered by GraphQL. It's also a little silly, if I'm being perfectly honest.</p>
                <p>
                   This component leverages two operations. The first operation is a Subscription operation, which is being used to receive events on newly added items in Sitecore. 
                   The second operation is a Mutation, which is used to create items and push our chat messages into Sitecore.
